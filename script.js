// Create a conditional statement that checks if two strings are equal. Include an if and else statement. Create an alert that gives your user feedback based on the string defined. Test your statement with different strings to make sure both alerts work.

let string1 = "Luiza";
let string2 = "Marsola";

if (string1 == string2) {
  alert("The strings are equal!");
} else {
  alert("The strings are not equal.");
